This repository contains the implementation of the Decentralized Internet Archive
realized in the context of a Master Thesis at the DEDIS laboratory at EPFL.

This repository is based on the DEDIS [cothority template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template).
It is highly experimental and still a prototype and should not be considered
secure or reliable for real-world purposes.

# Template for a new cothority protocol/service/app

Building on the ONet-library available at 
https://github.com/dedis/onet, this
repo holds templates to build the different parts necessary for a cothority
addition:

* protocol - define an ephemeral, distributed, decentralized protocol
* service - create a long-term service that can spawn any number of protocols
* app - write an app that will interact with, or spawn, a cothority

## Documentation

This project is related to an EPFL Master Thesis report which can be used as
a documentation. Plancherel Nicolas, Decentralized Internet Archive, EPFL 2018.

Furthermore, it is based on the Cothority Template.
You find more documentation on how to use the template on the wiki:

More documentation and examples can be found at:
- To run and use a conode, have a look at 
	[Cothority Node](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/wiki)
	with examples of protocols, services and apps
- To participate as a core-developer, go to
